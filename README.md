# Implementation of the Arousal Dynamics Model

This repository aims at implementing the arousal dynamics model as described in:

- _Postnova, S., Lockley, S. W., & Robinson, P. A. (2018). Prediction of cognitive performance and subjective sleepiness using a model of arousal dynamics. Journal of biological rhythms, 33(2), 203-218._
- _Tekieh, T., Lockley, S. W., Robinson, P. A., McCloskey, S., Zobaer, M., & Postnova, S. (2020). Modeling melanopsin‚Äêmediated effects of light on circadian phase, melatonin suppression, and subjective sleepiness. Journal of Pineal Research, 69(3), e12681._

Parameters and equations are taken from the papers.
